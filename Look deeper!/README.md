Looking deeply intp the image we see something:

![cipher text](deeper1.png?raw=true "cipher text")

The question is talking about some place so probably there are some GPS coordinates in the image.

It points to some place in Beaufort, South Carolina, USA.

![Beaufort](deeper3.png?raw=true "Beaufort")

Could Beaufort be related to a Cipher? Yes. And what about the pizza??
