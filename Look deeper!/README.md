# Solution

Looking deeply into the image we see some ciphertext hidden in the shadow:

![cipher text](deeper2.png?raw=true "cipher text")

The question is talking about some place so probably finding the GPS coordinates of the image would help.

![GPS coords](deeper1.png?raw=true "GPS coords")

It points to some place in Beaufort, South Carolina, USA.

![Beaufort](deeper3.png?raw=true "Beaufort")

Could Beaufort be related to a Cipher? Yes. But, what about the pizza??

Wasn't the `German` place better?? Yes! It was.
