# Solution

When you see encrypted text you know it involves a cipher. But what are they?

You will have two different ciphers. The clue is in the first sentence. When you search for `fence cipher` you get the `Rail Fence cipher`.

Mound must mean something - it is a synonym for hill and we have the `Hill Cipher`.

There are also 4 empty lines in the first clue.

![empty values](here1.png?raw=true "empty lines")

Now entering 4 in the configuration of the Rail Fence Cipher at two places, we get this:

![missing punctuation and spaces](here2.png?raw=true "missing punctuatin and spaces")

Did we miss some punctuation? Yes.

![matrix values](here3.png?raw=true "matrix values")

Now we use these values to decrypt the flag:

![flag](here4.png?raw=true "flag")

# Flag

`ctf{getting_up the_hill_was_hard}`
